# Hadoop MapReduce using MRJob in Python <hr>
-> What are the programming languages that supports MapReduce Programming? 
MapReduce programming can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, leveraging different frameworks and tools. Here are some of the languages commonly used for writing MapReduce programs:

1. **Java**: Java is the primary language for writing MapReduce programs, especially in the Hadoop framework. The Hadoop MapReduce API is designed with Java, making it a natural choice for developing MapReduce applications.

2. **Python**: Python can be used to write MapReduce programs through libraries like Pydoop or frameworks such as MRJob, which allow Python scripts to run on Hadoop clusters.

3. **C++**: Hadoop provides support for MapReduce programs written in C++ through the Hadoop Pipes API, which is a C++ library.

4. **Ruby**: Ruby can be used for MapReduce programming through frameworks like Hadoop Streaming, which allows any script or executable to be used as a mapper or reducer, provided it follows the standard input and output format.

5. **R**: R, a language popular for statistical computing, can be used for MapReduce programming with packages like RHadoop, which integrates R with Hadoop.

6. **Scala**: Scala is often used with Apache Spark, which provides a powerful alternative to Hadoop MapReduce for parallel data processing. Spark offers a high-level API in Scala for creating MapReduce-like operations.

7. **Perl**: Perl can be used with Hadoop Streaming to write MapReduce programs, as it supports reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

8. **PHP**: PHP scripts can also be used as mappers and reducers with Hadoop Streaming, allowing PHP developers to leverage MapReduce.

9. **Go**: Go can be used for MapReduce programming, particularly with libraries and tools designed to integrate Go programs with Hadoop or similar frameworks.

10. **Erlang**: Erlang, known for its concurrency and fault-tolerance, can be utilized for MapReduce programming in distributed environments, often in custom implementations or with specific libraries.

Each of these languages can be used with different MapReduce frameworks or tools, making it flexible to choose the one that best fits the developerâ€™s expertise and the specific requirements of the task. Hadoop Streaming, in particular, is a versatile tool that allows any programming language to be used as long as the program can read from standard input and write to standard output.<hr>
